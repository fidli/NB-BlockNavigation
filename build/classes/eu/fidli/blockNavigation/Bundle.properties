OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    You can use this plugin to jump downward/upward in current opened file<br/>\nor to jump to the beggining of (whitespace-free)sentence or end of one.\
    <br/>\n<br/>\nUpward and downward jump moves cursor behind first empty newline. \
    Allowing you to navigate quicker than by going up/down just one lane.\n\
    <br/>\nAs usual, you can redefine shortcuts for these 4 actions.\
    <br/>\nDefault: <br/>\nNavigate > Upward jump to another code chunk CTRL+UP<br/>\nNavigate > Downward jump to another code chunk CTRL+DOWN<br/>\nNavigate > Jump to beggining of segment ALT+LEFT<br/>\nNavigate > Jump to end of segment ALT+RIGHT<br/>\n<br/>\nJump to beginning/end of segment is like native jumping to the beggining of word, except for this jumps over all the words until whitespace is met.\
    <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, feel free to request features or report bugs or ask for help\n<br/>
